						<p>Artists use lines of thread to create curved patterns that can form various desirable shapes. This organic idea to use thread and nails to form angles has grown from an educational tool to an art form like no other. Artists from around the world continue to make their name through being able to execute string art uniquely. Their creations attract a global audience with an appreciation for intricate design. The best way to know where string art will go in the future is to understand what gave birth to this innovative visual art.</p>

                        <p>Crochet is a needlework technique performed using a crochet hook plus fiber or other similar material. Most typically, this material is yarn or crochet thread, but it might also be fabric, wire, twine, or other innovative material.</p>
						<p>The most popular goal in crochet is obvious: Crochet enthusiasts hope to complete crochet projects, which are typically objects that are useful, attractive or beneficial in some way. Popular projects include afghans, baby blankets, baby booties, scarves, hats, granny squares, shawls, purses, tote bags and others. It's possible to crochet a variety of different things, including jewelry, socks, and curtains.</p>

                        <p>Knitting is a method by which thread or yarn is used to create a cloth. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of loops, called stitches. As each row progresses, a new loop is pulled through an existing loop.</p>
                        <p>The active stitches are held on a needle until another loop can be passed through them. This process eventually results in a fabric, often used for garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine. There exist numerous styles and methods of hand knitting. Different types of yarns and needles may be used to achieve a plethora of knitted materials; these tools give the final piece a different colour, texture, weight, and/or integrity. Other factors that affect the end result include the needle's shape, thickness and malleability, as well as the yarn's fibre type, texture and twist.</p>

                        <p>Cross stitch is a form of counted thread embroidery that has been around for ages, and it is one of the easiest forms of hand embroidery to learn. </p>
                        <p>Cross stitch is comprised of X-shaped stitches done on fabric with an even and open weave like Aida or linen. Designs can be traditional or modern or anywhere in between. Cross stitch projects are often sold as kits, but you can also purchase basic supplies and come up with your own project.</p>
