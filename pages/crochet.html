							<p >The Basic Unit in Crochet: A Crochet Stitch
								</br>Each crochet project is comprised of crochet stitches. The basic crochet stitches are as follows: chain stitch, slip stitch, single crochet stitch, double crochet stitch, half double crochet stitch, treble crochet stitch double treble crochet stitch triple treble crochet stitch
								</br> Crochet enthusiasts can combine the basic stitches in various ways to create interesting stitch patterns. It's possible to create many different effects; stitch patterns can be lacy or solid, colorful or monochromatic, patterned or plain.
									A crochet pattern is a set of instructions for crocheting an item, or sometimes a related set of items. You can find crochet patterns in many places. Plenty of patterns are available for free on the Internet. (There are thousands of free crochet patterns in our archive alone!)
									Some crochet patterns are also available for sale. There are many crochet books that contain groupings of crochet patterns.
									There are magazines dedicated to crochet, and also craft magazines and general interest magazines where you'll also find crochet patterns included.
									</br>Usually, crochet designers write their patterns using abbreviations to save space. In order to read a crochet pattern, you have to understand this and familiarize yourself with the abbreviations included in the pattern.
									You'll usually be able to find the abbreviations in a logical place. With the patterns we've posted on our website, we put the abbreviations close to the top of each pattern, before the instructions. We also make a master list of crochet abbreviations available on our website.
									If you're pattern is from a book or magazine, you'll usually find the abbreviations listed somewhere in the front or the back of the publication. <cite><a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/crochet-definition-what-is-crochet-978572">The Spruce Crafts by Amy Solovay</a></cite></p>
