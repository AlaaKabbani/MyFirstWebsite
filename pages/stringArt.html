							<p>String art is one of the most aesthetically pleasing DIY projects you can think of. Often 
							referred to as pin-and-thread art, string art is an addicting artform that is inviting to the most experienced crafter
							and the newcomer alike. Through the creation of intricate designs, crafters turn a plank of wood into a work of art. 
							String art designs are not only fun projects but they are even better gifts. Is there a birthday or anniversary coming up? 
							Your string art creation is a unique way to show your loved ones that you care.</br> String art is not a new fad; its origins 
							go back to the 19th century. It is the brainchild of Mary Everest Boole who was in search of a way to introduce children to 
							mathematical ideals. String art came back in the late 1960s as a decorative craft in the form of books and kits. Today, 
							string art is utilized by art lovers young and old as a pastime, DIY project, and much more..
